      Every season is good in its own way. But we start with autumn as it is the
      most beautiful season in a year. In autumn the weather starts to change
      for cold. It gets rainy and the air is moist. The days become shorter and
      the nights become longer. In late autumn the frost covers the ground at
      night. Nature fades away and nothing can be done about it.

      November is the month of bare trees, of the first signs of winter, and of
      the first snow. The trees have lost almost all their leaves. Only the
      oaks, which are the last to get their leaves and the last to lose them,
      still have brown leaves on. As trees have no leaves on, you can discover
      nests which were hidden during the summer.

        The weather begins to get cold</a
      >, and more and more animals go to sleep. The raccoon stays at home and
      sleeps most of the time. The black bears stay near their dens until it is
      very cold. Then they go in for their long winter sleep.
